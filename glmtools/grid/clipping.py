Later: check to see why Clipper isn't used in Agg instead of Sutherland-Hodgman. 
There is an Agg demo in the Clipper source.
Would be good to do a demo with some radar data to see just how fast this could be
vs. pcolormesh.


Also, there all mesh quads could probably be processed simultaneously if we
made the change to clipper described below.

and unlikely to change much now before formal release) doesn't have any polygon
merging so should do what you want ...

Alternatively you could comment out the the JoinCommonEdges() statement in the
ExecuteInternal method in the old Clipper."

        polys is an (N, M, 2) array or N-element list of (M,2) arrays
        of N polygons with M vertices in two dimensions.
        
        if bbox = (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) is present, slice with the mesh
        subset within that bbox. If bbox is true, use the dimensions of each
        poly to figure out the bbox. Otherwise, n nearest neighbors as
        configured for the QuadMeshSubset object are returned, using a KDTree lookup.
        
        Returns (sliced_poly_list, orig_poly_areas)
        
        orig_poly_areas are the areas of the polygons passed in. These are
        calculated as a byproduct.
        
        sliced_poly_list is a list of length N for each of the original N polys.
        Each list entry contains a tuple giving the properties of each sliced
        quad that intersects the original poly. The list entries are
        (sub_quad_polys, frac_areas, (x_idxs, y_idxs))
        Each element of the tuple above is of length Q for the Q quads 
        intersected by the original poly.
        
        Each list entry in sub_quad_polys is another list of vertices for each 
        of the Q quads having the fractional areas given in frac_areas.
        
        The indices index mesh.X_ctr, mesh.Y_ctr but also work as the
        low-index corner of the mesh edge arrays. Therefore, the indices can 
        be used to retrieve values from data arrays having the geometry of the
        original mesh.
